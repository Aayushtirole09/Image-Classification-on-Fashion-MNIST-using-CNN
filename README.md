# Image-Classification-on-Fashion-MNIST-using-CNN
This project implements a TensorFlow/Keras CNN to classify 28Ã—28 grayscale images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into ten clothing categories. Data is normalized and reshaped before training with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy, achieving high accuracy for e-commerce tagging, retail inventory, and real-time mobile apps.
