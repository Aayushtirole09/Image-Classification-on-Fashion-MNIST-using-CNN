# Image-Classification-on-Fashion-MNIST-using-CNN
This project presents a deep learning approach for classifying fashion items using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 28Ã—28 grayscale images of clothing across ten categories such as T-shirt/top, trouser, dress, and sneaker. Preprocessing steps include normalization, reshaping, and label handling to ensure efficient learning. The architecture features stacked convolutional and pooling layers with batch normalization, followed by dropout and dense layers to achieve strong generalization while avoiding overfitting. Trained with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss for 10 epochs, the model achieves high test accuracy and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data. Potential applications include automated product tagging for e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, and real-time mobile classification through TensorFlow Lite. Future enhancements could incorporate data augmentation, transfer learning with pretrained networks such as ResNet or MobileNet, hyperparameter tuning, and explainability techniques like Grad-CAM to further improve accuracy and deployment readiness.
